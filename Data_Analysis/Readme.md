**Reflection**
First, consider your data conversation and how it went. Here are some questions to help you get started:

    Was there anything challenging about getting the conversation started?

    Were there questions you didn’t get to ask?

    Did you manage your time effectively?

    Did you take notes? Are they as detailed as you need them to be?

    Are you missing any information? Is there anything that you still find unclear or vague?

    If you could do the conversation over again, is there anything you would change?

Next, turn your attention to your notes and reflect on what you know about the data itself:

    What are the sources of data available for the project?

    Which data sources were qualitative and which were quantitative? Explain your answer.

    What decisions could you make when considering each data source separately? Could you make different decisions about the data if you combined it? If so, give an example.

    Is there any kind of data that isn’t available, but you would like to find? If so, what is it, and why would you like to know more about it?

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Data

| Qualitative data tools         | Quantitative data tools |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Focus groups                   | Structured interviews   |
| Social media text interactions | Surveys                 |
| In-person interviews           | Polls                   |

## Dashboard
> A dashboard is a single point of access for managing a business's information. It allows analysts to pull key information from data in a quick review by visualizing the data in a way that makes findings easy to understand. 
### Types of dashboards
> Strategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
> - These dashboards provide information over the longest time frame—from a single financial quarter to years. 
> - They typically contain information that is useful for enterprise-wide decision-making. 
<img src="Data_Analysis/img/strategic_dashboard.png" width="600">

> Operational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals
> - these dashboards contain information on a time scale of days, weeks, or months, they can provide performance insight almost in real-time. 
> - This allows businesses to track and maintain their immediate operational processes in light of their strategic goals.
<img src="Data_Analysis/img/operational_dashboard.png" width="600">

> Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets
> - Analytic dashboards contain a vast amount of data used by data analysts. These dashboards contain the details involved in the usage, analysis, and predictions made by data scientists. 
> -  Analytic dashboards are usually created and maintained by data science teams and rarely shared with upper management as they can be very difficult to understand.
<img src="Data_Analysis/img/analytical_dashboard.png" width="600">

## Big and Small Data
> Small Data
> - Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period.
> - Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets.
> - Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses.
> - Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent .
> - Usually already a manageable size for analysis.

> Big Data
> - Describes large, less-specific data sets that cover a long time period.
> - Usually kept in a database and queried.
> - Likely to be used by large organizations.
> - Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent.
> - Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making.

> Challenges with Big data:
> - A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information. 
> - Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.
> - The data you need isn’t always easily accessible. 
> - Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias. 
> - There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

> Benefits of Big data:
> - When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.
> - Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.
> - By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.
> - Big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.
> - **volume** : The amount of data.
> - **Variety** : The different kinds of data.
> - **Velocity** : How fast the data can be processed.
> - **Veracity** : The quality and reliability of the data.

## Spreadsheets and the data life cycle

> **Plan**: formatting your cells, the headings you choose to highlight, the color scheme, and the way you order your data points. 

> **Capture**: Capture data by the source by connecting spreadsheets to other data sources, such as an online survey application or a database. This data will automatically be updated in the spreadsheet. That way, the information is always as current and accurate as possible.

> **Manage**: storing, organizing, filtering, and updating information. Spreadsheets also let you decide who can access the data, how the information is shared, and how to keep your data safe and secure. 

> **Analyze**:  formulas to aggregate data or create reports, and pivot tables for clear, easy-to-understand visuals. 

> **Archive**: store historical data 

> **Destroy**: Destroy your spreadsheet when you are certain that you will never need it again, if you have better backup copies, or for legal or security reasons. Keep in mind, lots of businesses are required to follow certain rules or have measures in place to make sure data is destroyed properly.	

## Scope of work (SOW) and structured thinking

> Not to be confused with *statement of work* also *SOW*
>
> A **statement of work** is a document that clearly identifies the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide to an organization. It includes objectives, guidelines, deliverables, schedule, and costs. 
>
>A **scope of work** is project-based and sets the expectations and boundaries of a project. A scope of work may be included in a statement of work to help define project outcomes. 
>
> **structured thinking** is the process of recognizing the current situation, organizing information, and identifing opportunities. 

> **Scope of work**

> - Deliverables : are items or tasks you will complete before you can finish the project. What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project? When the project is complete, what are you expected to deliver to the stakeholders? Be specific here. Will you collect data for this project? How much, or for how long?. Avoid vague statements. For example, “fixing traffic problems” doesn’t specify the scope. This could mean anything from filling in a few potholes to building a new overpass. Be specific! Use numbers and aim for hard, measurable goals and objectives. For example: “Identify top 10 issues with traffic patterns within the city limits, and identify the top 3 solutions that are most cost-effective for reducing traffic congestion.”
>
> - Milestones : are significant tasks you will confirm along your timeline to help everyone know the project is on track.his is closely related to your timeline. What are the major milestones for progress in your project? How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete? Milestones can be identified by you, by stakeholders, or by other team members such as the Project Manager. Smaller examples might include incremental steps in a larger project like “Collect and process 50% of required data (100 survey responses)”, but may also be larger examples like ”complete initial data analysis report” or “deliver completed dashboard visualizations and analysis reports to stakeholders”. 
>
> - Timeline : include due dates for when deliverables, milestones, and/or reports are due. Your timeline will be closely tied to the milestones you create for your project. The timeline is a way of mapping expectations for how long each step of the process should take. The timeline should be specific enough to help all involved decide if a project is on schedule. When will the deliverables be completed? How long do you expect the project will take to complete? If all goes as planned, how long do you expect each component of the project will take? When can we expect to reach each milestone?
>
> - Reports : notify everyone as you finalize deliverables and meet milestones. Good SOWs also set boundaries for how and when you’ll give status updates to stakeholders. How will you communicate progress with stakeholders and sponsors, and how often? Will progress be reported weekly? Monthly? When milestones are completed? What information will status reports contain?

> SOWs should also contain information specific to what is and isn’t considered part of the project. The scope of your project is everything that you are expected to complete or accomplish, defined to a level of detail that doesn’t leave any ambiguity or confusion about whether a given task or item is part of the project or not. 

## The Importance of Context

*Context can turn raw data into meaningful information*. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

- Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection

- What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on

- Where: The origin of the data

- When: The time when the data was created or collected

- Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection

- How: The method used to create or collect it

## How to communicate your analysis and recommendations

Be sure to answer these four important questions related to your audience:

 - Who is your audience? 

 - What do they already know? 

 - What do they need to know? 

 - How can you best communicate what they need to know?
